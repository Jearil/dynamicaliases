DynamicAliases is a shell script that allows you to save and run aliases quickly from the shell. The code is based on
the amazing [Bashmarks](https://github.com/huyng/bashmarks) project which I highly recommend.

Install
====
1. git clone git://github.com/jearil/dynamicaliases.git
2. cd dynamicaliases
3. make install
4. source ~/.local/bin/dynamicaliases.sh from within your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc file.
